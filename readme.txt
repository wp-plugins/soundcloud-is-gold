Browse through your soundcloud tracks from a tab in the post's 'upload media'. Select, add a track to your post. Live preview, easy.

== Description ==

**Soundcloud is Gold** integrates perfectly into wordpress. Browse through your soundcloud tracks from the 'Soundcloud is gold' tab in the post's 'upload media' popup window. Select, set and add track to your post using the soundcloud player. Live Preview, easy, smart and straightforward.
You can set default settings in the option page, choose your defaut soundcloud player (Mini, Standard, Artwork), it's width, add extra classes for you CSS lovers, show comments, autoplay and your favorite color.
You'll also be able to set players to different settings before adding to your post if you fancy a one off change.

**Soundcloud is Gold** use a shortcode but the "Soundcloud is Gold" tab will write it for you dynamicly as you select parameters, and on top of this it will provide a nice live preview of your player so you know what does what. When done just press the 'insert soundcloud player' and it will added to your post just like when you're adding a photo or gallery.

= Features =

* Browse through your soundcloud tracks from a tab in the media upload window (see screenshot), no need to go back and forth between soundcloud and your website.
* Live Preview in the Tab, see what does what instantly (see screenshot).
* Integrates perfectly with wordpress media upload by using the same listing style that you get with the images (see screenshot).
* See track's info directly in the tab (description, url, cover, etc...).

    * Width
    * Extra Classes for the div that wraps around the player
    * Auto Play
    * Show/Hide Comments
    * Player's Colors

* Plugin construct shortode for you, no need to remember any syntax.
* Follow WP developpers guidelines (enqueue scripts and styles just for the plugin, clean code, commented, secure and leave no trace when uninstall )

= Advantages against pasting embed code from soundcloud =

* By changing the main settings in the options, all players on your site using the default settings will change. If green isn't trendy anymore and black is the new white, it won't be a problem and you keep your street credibility safe.
* If Soundcloud update their player or release a even cooler new player that let you scratch your track while streaming to google+, I will most defenetly update the plugin to use those new features.

That's just my opinion of course...


= How to use the shortcode manually =

If for some reason you wish to use the shortcode manually, like for embeding someone else tracks, you can use:

**[soundcloud id='10450254']**

This will use your default setting of with, classes, colors, autoplay, comments. (Replace *10450254* with the track id you want to show)

If you wish to have more control here is an example:

**[soundcloud id='10450254' comments='true' autoPlay='false' playerType='Standard' width='100%' color='#005bff']**


= To Do List =

* Possibility to add multiple users for thoses with multiple soundcloud account.
* Possibility to set a different user in the 'Soundcloud is Gold tab' to add tracks from different people.
* Add Soundcloud default Width to the options
* Style sortcode in TinyMCE (editor) because it would be cool and neat;
* Trigger live preview when changing Soundcloud user name
* Live search while typing a name in the user name field. So if you're looking for someone it's kind of easier.
* pagination in tab (is it really needed?)


== Installation ==

Just follow the usual procedure. Log on to your wordpress, go to plugin -> add new -> search 'Soundcloud is Gold' -> click install



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I request features? =

Yes, you can. If asked nicely and the requests are sensibles, I almost always integrate them to new releases.

= Can you help me? =

Sometimes, I generaly keep a eye on my plugin's forums and website's comments. Bear in mind that I've got a full time job and a life, so I can't always help straight away.
